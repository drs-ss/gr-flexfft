Welcome to the GNU Radio FlexFFT Block

This is the intro page for the Doxygen manual generated for the FlexFFT
block (docs/doxygen/other/main_page.dox). The FlexFFT sink is designed
to display FlexFFT packets from either the gr-polaris block or directly
from the radio.

This block is a modified copy of the "in tree" block time_sink_f taken
from the gr-qtgui module of GNURadio.
